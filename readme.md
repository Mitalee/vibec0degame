## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/mitalee/vibec0degame.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Open any of the game HTML files in your browser:
   - `index.html` for Snake Game
   - `ttt.html` for Tic Tac Toe

Alternatively, you can simply download the individual HTML files - each game is completely self-contained in a single file.

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Snake Game

You can easily customize the Snake Game by editing the `config` object in the JavaScript section:

```javascript
const config = {
    gridSize: 20,        // Number of cells in the grid
    cellSize: 20,        // Size of each cell in pixels
    initialSpeed: 350,   // Starting speed (higher = slower)
    speedIncrease: 1     // How much speed increases with each food
};
```

### Tic Tac Toe

The Tic Tac Toe game can be customized by modifying the CSS styles to match your preferred color scheme or by replacing the sound files with your own audio clips.

## üì± Mobile Support

Both games support touch devices, but keyboard controls (arrow keys and spacebar) require a physical or on-screen keyboard.

## üéµ Audio Attribution

The sample sounds used in these games are from various free sound libraries. If you plan to use these games commercially, consider replacing the sounds with your own audio files.

## üìú License
